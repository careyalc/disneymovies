#Disney Movies
### by Alex Carey

## Purpose
My Disney Movies Django web app homepage will display a grid view of all the Disney characters available in my database, with clickable images above each character name on the home page. Each character will get its own spot in the grid, not every character may have an image, however. Once the user clicks on the character, they are taken to a page where they can see who voiced that character, what movie the character is in, and what other movies the voice actor appears in. Then, the user can click on the movie and see more information about that movie. This page may have other interesting facts about the movie or the cover artwork. 

This app will allow users to learn more about Disney characters, and actors, and how they relate to multiple Disney movies. 

## Data Set
The data for this project was taken from a project found on data.world. The original files can be found [here](https://data.world/kgarrett/disney-character-success-00-16). I will not be using all of these files, but instead parts to create relationships between the actors, characters, movies, directors, etc. More details can be seen in the data model below.
